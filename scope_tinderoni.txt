Scope for tinderoni
-------------------

use-cases
---------
- talent scout
- self-esteem booster
- data insights for daters people
	- self-awareness of the types of demographics who appeal to me
	- the type of people I'm interested in
- creating a simple auto-swiper
* which star do you look most similar to? Do i actually look most similar to george clooney?
Could also use my RT recommender for this.
- if you were a movie producer and you were looking for a cast member

Have you ever had a crush on a girl? or would you care to see how your past partners line-up to your current set of likes?
- Use the recommender


What would be even MORE interesting is to examine the set of people that actually match with you and distinguish those people from the broader group?
- However, I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. This would be a fun insightful exercise but i don't match. There are lots of variables in place other than they just don't find me attractive.

Learn how to spin up an AWS cluster and do the actions below:

#get only the first pic from dislikes DONE

#take the first face from tinder_pics_likes_faces_deduped DONE

#label the likes/dislikes and umap, see if they're different from one another

#hdbscan / umap for CF_males and
#add stars to this
#inspect imdb set and make recommender

#try clustering with GMM

#try cosinels DONE





dislikes
------
- extract faces and align DONE
- get only the first photo DONE
- dedupe; spin up a big cluster and do it 
- encode; find an easy way to provision the cluster; try EMR route


likes
------
- get only the first photo
- encode


likes (from last year)
------
- dedupe
- extract faces and align
- get only the first photo
- encode

do the dissimilarity for the AF and CFs, TSNE

- which start is raq closest to?


CM dataset notes
-----

- get photos of mike and jamie and do the same exercise

note cm688 is an indian guy

*if i wanted to choose a good face shot of myself I'd iterate through my reel and choose the ones that falls in the same quadrant as the stars
- check if the tsne plots were done on the face and not just the encodings of the entire pic
- see what clusters I get with HDScAN? DONE
- run on likes and dislikes? does it find fat girls?
- understand what's going on with the ecoding and see if we could extract features from them
- hypothesis tests: see where raquel lands among the set of models and uggs, lets find a fat girl and see what happens? 

- inspecting the montages of the hots and nots, what main pattern can we see? same for tsne plots. audrey hepburn and madonna? Why are some hots in the nots and vice versa? Is there a way to extract these features? Where would mom fall? where would raquel fall? where would I fall?
- organize folder
- play around with the perplexity at 10: it seems to be cluster like pictures better at 10 than it does at 30 but it's also more splayed out and scattered losing it's ellipsodal shape. that website claims that tsne sucks for doing this but I see it more like highlighting a pair of similar points instead for visual inspection instead of having everything look equidistant. take a glance at the jpegs in the tsne trial folder. The associations with perp 10 look much more clear

- come-up with a principled way to examine goodness of approach e.g. pre-determined outliers where do they lie, does it catch all of the same people, I could literally go through the entire set and swipe on them again effectively relabel them and make a roc-auc curve.

DONE
- examine cluster and try to optimize the cluster.. consider level set tree, t-sne, etc. perhaps it might even make sense to send out an email to adrian
- train the model on facial beauty and try to get the one on fatness
- faces need to be aligned
- do we need to encode the faces into a feature space before we feed them to a clustering algorithm? check by flatten rgb and using it on the faces to see if it yields similar results
- also use HDSCANN
- t-SNE on the encodings
- how can i understand global structure
- validation of a clustering algorithm can be validated by the linkage to the names of the files and clusters e.g. cluster_1 corresponding file names should have the same name.

- Which classifiers? *
	- Facenet
	- convnet

- Analysis
	How many group photos on average does each person have?
		this probably not good for figuring who you are

	What are the most frequent girl names?

	What the groups of pictures that I like? Do they cluster distinctly? Do I have a type?
		- t-sne on corpus of positives
		This approach might not work well because it's not indicative of the one pic that got me to swipe, but it does say something about the people.

		- positive & negative clusters and use a classifier on their profiles



	What the groups of pictures are that I don't like? Do they cluster distinctly?
		- t-sne on corpus of negatives
	
	Is there any delineation between the two groups?
		- t-sne on positives and negatives

	Can crop out the faces and see if there are any patterns?
		https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/09/face-clustering-with-python/
			- facial detection via CNN or Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
			- then it encodes the cropped face
			- dbscann to cluster the output
		
		could also train on the attractiveness paper dataset and run the convnet through the images since it possess images of white women. However, lets be speculative.


	If I make my neighborhood new york versus local do the girl's get cuter?
		- pull down 1000 pictures from each and see which ones are more attrative
			how do you rate attractives?
				- either from a classifier or from human inspection. though a classifier is much more rigorous

			* take into account distance
			Are girls that are further away, way cuter?

			What's the average distance of each category?
	What are there facial expressions?
	What are they're ages?
		- plot histogram: positive and negative labels
		- 
	What are they're hair color?
	What are the topics in the bio?
	What's the average height?
	How often do they post hieght?
	Where do they live?
		 Perhaps this would give you insight on where to move next?

	What's the average guy height?
	Which ethnicities are on it the most?
	Are two cities quite different from one another?
	Is there a bias for seasonality
	Are the girls on other apps cuter?
		I need to pull down happn
		OKC already has their thing made
	Rate of swiping right
	Is there any patterns in the meta data?
		- how to extract meta data from the image

	Could also take a mirror and check for symmetry by taking the euclidean distance of each photo.
		- would have to fix for images which are expressionless e.g. eye-wink

	How selective am I?
	- suppose a significantly large portion of a single's are on tinder. Meaning it's somewhat representative of the girl's I'd see at an average bar or some venue or on the street. How often than not am I saying yeah she's cute? Obviously this makes some wild assumptions to people you see at venues like bars / clubs, they tend to narrow down a particular type of demographic.  That said, the population on tinder doesn't  focus on a particular demographic as much as a bar does, however you have settings to a couple miles radius in West Village new york. i.e. tinder has a wider audience but it doesn't do some narrowing.

	Anyways, the main point speaks to your selectivity: Am I being realistic with my desires? Am I overappraising my self-worth? Am I not being selective enough, casting too wide a net?


- What's an objective measure for what is considered attractive?


- App
	1) pull down nearest matches
	2) classify which ones you said yes to automonously
		- is it important to say dislike in tinder?

tasks

	- What do I need to do mine form Happn? OKC? (30 mins)
	- other computer vision models? (30 mins)

- Setup infrastructure to mine data (30 mins)
	Append these fields to CSV which is pipe delimited
	- start collecting bio, 
	- distance, 
	- Age
	- School
	- Jobs
	- names from Tinder
- can i reiterate on the above? i.e. look at the information collected and see what we could clean from it. All while continuing to collect
- fix the error: KeyError: 'id' 
- organize folders
- make a function to collect likes and dislikes
- start collecting swipes
- make a last year folder
- How many images do I need?

ideas
----
- train the model on my pics
- to show a scatter plot of the images just censor the eyes to avoid identification
- object detection within the photos

random qs
----
is t-SNE no longer the best clustering algo?



notes
----
Most clustering algos are off shoots of k-means which is one of the first algos. Easy to interpret and widely available and fast. However it sucks at actually finding clusters, it assumes a globular shape and often misclassify noise as a part of a cluster... It's actually not even a clustering algorithm it just partitions data i.e. it segments the space the data lives in. We also have to specify the number k before hand which could be tricky. 

Agglomerative, spectral are off shoots of k-means but graph based and we don't have to pre determine k. But they still suck at clustering the data.. i.e. they all fragment.

PS. Stability of a cluster is an important point. Can it reproduce reusults upon reruns.

Dbscan picks up the weaknesses of k-means in the context of performance, it segments the data... It's just weak because of epsilon which hdbscan chooses for you. 

ask adrian
How can I an understanding of the cluster's global structures i.e. how they relate to one another. 

Cluster validation on image data is pretty easy, given it's visual.

lets see if the clustering algos can distinguish between race of people, we could determine that as it's a goodness. 

Getting global structure using 
using soft assignment to a cluster perhaps might yield a better picture from a global perspective

Also lets see what the scatter plot looks like

How the encoding works for Facial Recognition vs FaceNet (cutting edge)?
	- Facial recognition quick overview 
	ResNet-34 
	the network has already been trained to create 128-d embeddings on a dataset of ~3 million images.
	- Facenet's supposed to be the best out there and probably should be used in the final version of this. But it's for a later iteration.

Best way to Dl images?
	- bing search api from pyimagesearch

use-cases
STOP TOILET PAPER THIEVES
- authentication, like a fingerprint... but there's not touching involved, garauntees uniqueness in this case
- pet identification if it's lost
- customization, say if you hop into a car and adjusts your seat, mirrors, etc
- image touch-ups and corrections
- VR could put me in a whole new working environment 
- Banks and ATMS could definitely use facial recognition
- Concentration levels of the face
- Given my face, can i figure out which faces I'm attracted to the most? (figure out where my face cluster)
- Are the people happy / sad?
- shoplifting, general happiness or mood of shoppers
- lie detection
- physical abuse
- payments
- Pricing and anything that uses human eye inspection
- Is my cut infected?
- Nude detection
- Self driving cars

features
-------
- angry, 
- sad, 
- happy


My favorite pornstars, recommendor

- Don't rush: to be original you don't have to be first, you just have to be different and better. more time to expand creative process thought
	- don't ever self-doubt, it's the antithesis to self-confidence. 
		- always isolate to the specific event
	- first movers often fail the most: napster, myspace, altavista

What are the best Tinder hacks?
https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Tinder-hacks
The girls who were writing boasted highest views, naturally women are the most concerned with relationships.

I should offer suggestions, because what the popular views of quoro show people want to learn: experiment around most importnatly - this is like an arms race and behooves you to stay uptodate, see what other guys are doing after you create a new profile of the opposite sex and do something better than them. e.g. create interesting photoshopped images. Answers and hacks are constantly bubbling up and people are constantly adapting to them as such, good ol fashioned trial and error is the only way to continually stay ahead of the pack.

How often do you find yourself focusing on what you lack when it comes to your dating success( or there lack of)?
- Like only if I was taller, then I'd get more matches, only if I was x,y,z then these are some interesting opportunities to experiment with and remember when you're a new person, you're profile will automatically get shown more.

Know your customer, girls.
Look at their bios and read about what they want in a man and see if you can cater to it. ( this tough this assumes they're aware of what they want, girls are always saying shit like they want a nice and end-up with the badboy), but it's worth a shot.

More matches isn't necessarily a good thing, polarization

* I should do a clustering exercise on bios

what was the success rate of me matching with any of these people?
Not sure, that wasnt a part of the exercise but very low and I was only interested in finding my taste for this very reason. (https://www.quora.com/Am-I-ugly-if-I-can-t-get-matches-on-Tinder-Because-I-have-been-told-my-pictures-are-nice-but-I-have-been-on-Tinder-for-3-weeks-and-only-have-1-match). I know it's driven by the elo-score or whatever but in either case, it's too damn time consuming and my odds IRL are much better.

What are the universal laws of attraction?
Men one's that are more concerned with looks, as such the article will probably cater to men however there's a sense of individual expression through photos, afterall they're worth a 1000 words. 

Suggestions on where to go based on your use case? to flat out say Tinder < Bumble << OKC is kind of short-sighted to their individual use-case.

What are the most popular questions & answers in online dating?

Topic Online Dating
	How come that girls doesn't reply when you message them on Okcupid or Tinder?
	- a clear reason not to take online dating seriously; it's so cumbersome. the challenge deosn't end at endlessly swiping and matching but then getting them to reply, a phone number, then eventually a date. But it 's a great way to figure out taste.

	What are some marketing techniques men can employ when dating online?*
	- How to better thyself
	- Look-up the hacks and see if I could dive deeper here
	- 

	What is the hardest thing about achieving success in online dating?
	- What the pitfalls / challenges of online dating? Why is shared interest not enough? Why aren't photos enough?
	- effort
	- catfishing

Topic Tinder


	Is everyone on Tinder basically a loser because they have to go online to find dates?
	- emphasize the importnace of online dating, FB getting into space, Bumble is to go IPO, hinge got acquired. And look at the charts.

	What are your "definite NO's" while swiping on Tinder? 
	- Are you aware of them and why?
	- You have some sort of nonsense about women in your bio. This includes: demanding to pay for the first date, talking about how women who sleep with you are easy, “not looking for sluts”, calling girls “bitches”, and so on. Ew.

	Why should a guy bother with Tinder if he does not have a six pack and grade A looks?
	- Tinder is still the dominant dating app out there and it's easy to get a good idea.
		

	I want a serious relationship. Should I use eHarmony, OK Cupid, or Tinder?

	Does Tinder work without paying the fee?

What are the most popular questions & answers in dating?


Dating is hard, there are girls I have nothing in common with but I want to have sex with them and there are girls I have a lot in common with but I don't want to have sex with them at all: how can we find the intersection.
