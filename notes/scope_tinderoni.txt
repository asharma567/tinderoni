- kiddy porn finder 
- Scarlett's variance of results demonstrated, make-up has a huge role so if one wanted to conform to certain standard in beauty they could by making their face more define and then taking a photo of it. This solves that problem of: Did I put my make-up on right

- talent scout

- data insights for daters people
	- self-awareness of the types of demographics who appeal to me
	- the type of people I'm interested in

- creating a simple auto-swiper

- which star do you look most similar to? Do i actually look most similar to george clooney?

Could also use my RT recommender for this.
- if you were a movie producer and you were looking for a cast member

Have you ever had a crush on a girl? or would you care to see how your past partners line-up to your current set of likes?
- Use the recommender

What would be even MORE interesting is to examine the set of people that actually match with you and distinguish those people from the broader group?
- However, I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. This would be a fun insightful exercise but i don't match. There are lots of variables in place other than they just don't find me attractive.

*RECOMMENDER: if i wanted to choose a good face shot of myself I'd iterate through my reel and choose the ones that falls in the same quadrant as the stars

- stop toilet paper thieves
- authentication, like a fingerprint... but there's not touching involved, garauntees uniqueness in this case
- pet identification if it's lost
- customization, say if you hop into a car and adjusts your seat, mirrors, etc
- image touch-ups and corrections
- VR could put me in a whole new working environment 
- Banks and ATMS could definitely use facial recognition
- Concentration levels of the face

- Questions Analysis
	How many group photos on average does each person have?
		this probably not good for figuring who you are

	What are the most frequent girl names?

	What the groups of pictures that I like? Do they cluster distinctly? Do I have a type?
		- t-sne on corpus of positives
		This approach might not work well because it's not indicative of the one pic that got me to swipe, but it does say something about the people.

		- positive & negative clusters and use a classifier on their profiles



	What the groups of pictures are that I don't like? Do they cluster distinctly?
		- t-sne on corpus of negatives
	
	Is there any delineation between the two groups?
		- t-sne on positives and negatives

	Can crop out the faces and see if there are any patterns?
		https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/09/face-clustering-with-python/
			- facial detection via CNN or Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
			- then it encodes the cropped face
			- dbscann to cluster the output
		
		could also train on the attractiveness paper dataset and run the convnet through the images since it possess images of white women. However, lets be speculative.


	If I make my neighborhood new york versus local do the girl's get cuter?
		- pull down 1000 pictures from each and see which ones are more attrative
			how do you rate attractives?
				- either from a classifier or from human inspection. though a classifier is much more rigorous

			* take into account distance
			Are girls that are further away, way cuter?

			What's the average distance of each category?
	What are there facial expressions?
	What are they're ages?
		- plot histogram: positive and negative labels
		- 
	What are they're hair color?
	What are the topics in the bio?
	What's the average height?
	How often do they post hieght?
	Where do they live?
		 Perhaps this would give you insight on where to move next?

	What's the average guy height?
	Which ethnicities are on it the most?
	Are two cities quite different from one another?
	Is there a bias for seasonality
	Are the girls on other apps cuter?
		I need to pull down happn
		OKC already has their thing made
	Rate of swiping right
	Is there any patterns in the meta data?
		- how to extract meta data from the image

	Could also take a mirror and check for symmetry by taking the euclidean distance of each photo.
		- would have to fix for images which are expressionless e.g. eye-wink

	How selective am I?
	- suppose a significantly large portion of a single's are on tinder. Meaning it's somewhat representative of the girl's I'd see at an average bar or some venue or on the street. How often than not am I saying yeah she's cute? Obviously this makes some wild assumptions to people you see at venues like bars / clubs, they tend to narrow down a particular type of demographic.  That said, the population on tinder doesn't  focus on a particular demographic as much as a bar does, however you have settings to a couple miles radius in West Village new york. i.e. tinder has a wider audience but it doesn't do some narrowing.

	Anyways, the main point speaks to your selectivity: Am I being realistic with my desires? Am I overappraising my self-worth? Am I not being selective enough, casting too wide a net?


	- What's an objective measure for what is considered attractive? How can I figure 

	- Purge to NB Why is this less interesting then finding a neighborhood

	1) pull down nearest matches
	2) classify which ones you said yes to automonously
		- is it important to say dislike in tinder?

	- Find a way to link pictures and text, finding a correlation between pictures and text

notes
----
Most clustering algos are off shoots of k-means which is one of the first algos. Easy to interpret and widely available and fast. However it sucks at actually finding clusters, it assumes a globular shape and often misclassify noise as a part of a cluster... It's actually not even a clustering algorithm it just partitions data i.e. it segments the space the data lives in. We also have to specify the number k before hand which could be tricky. 

Agglomerative, spectral are off shoots of k-means but graph based and we don't have to pre determine k. But they still suck at clustering the data.. i.e. they all fragment.

PS. Stability of a cluster is an important point. Can it reproduce reusults upon reruns.

Dbscan picks up the weaknesses of k-means in the context of performance, it segments the data... It's just weak because of epsilon which hdbscan chooses for you. 

ask adrian
How can I an understanding of the cluster's global structures i.e. how they relate to one another. 

Cluster validation on image data is pretty easy, given it's visual.

lets see if the clustering algos can distinguish between race of people, we could determine that as it's a goodness. 

Getting global structure using 
using soft assignment to a cluster perhaps might yield a better picture from a global perspective

Also lets see what the scatter plot looks like

Representation of gods
-----------------------

	This findings came about when I noticed a facial similarity between my mom / family and the gods.

	Separately, the connection with hindu gods; Most of the gods are depicted as blue or fair skinned and appear to be very north indian looking by features. Big eyes, eye lashes, narrow nose - Aryan features ( indo aryan to be precise ). This is in stark contrast to south indians who have wider noses and thicker lips. Today, there's still a preference for fair skin in indian media.

	I'm in nepal now where people look far different and they're even praying to pictures which portray a north indian person. How is this different from american media where whites govern the standards of aesthetics and parade physical ideals of their definition around us. 

	How did buddha become a fat jovial chinese guy? He clearly was a skinny indian guy?

	Assumption: The net is using facial structure and not skin color.

	Is what's popular choice even matter any more? If it's all made-up and become synthetically popularized and the in a cycle of habit, who cares?


Should women use apps like tinder?
	- I think swiping caters more towards men. Meaning you very well could be attracted to someone physically but not have compatible personalities. This a balance dating apps are struggling with.
	- if it's purely measured on looks then it's much more analogous to how men choose to pursue a mate. Why are men more visually stimulated is a deeper topic.

	What happens if my likes are scattered and don't show any pattern?
	- you may just be indifferent to looks, maybe more weight towards physiological features.

What do I do with this information?
	- don't use it to feed your swipe pattern, given how selective I hardly match besides, it's not just me or you, it's the app. Inspecting another analysis of who was fairly rigorous a 2.6 match rate is hardly worth your time. 
	- So what then should I do? Figure out your type and next time you come across someone like that cold approach her. or and this is what tinder probably angling for, buy some of there extras like stars but now youre fairly informed on who you should focus your resources on ( that's the big takeaway. Because you can't approach every girl and even though you can swipe right on everyone indiscriminately you can't have a genuine conversation with everyone with you match with. This a clear way to be more efficient with your efforts. 
	- The the average person in your clusters
	- your ethnic clusters
	- Your demographic ( tbd )
	- while it may reaffirm something you already know it's nice to have it back by analysis. It's nice to know your type. 

I like all types of women given they're beautiful
	- well what's beautiful? doll face or structured, petite or voluptuous, mainstream... laid back or type a (This exercise can only be done with a personality analysis). Though pic are worth a thousand words, we can just limit to physique for this exercise. Beauty is a fairly subjective topic so an analysis like this might be worth while.


This isn't intended for an audience who is just looking to get laid. It's much more about meeting someone for the long term.

Mainstream or controversial?
	- it also uncovers how close my type is to mainstream good looks or outside* 

Link to the gaurdian video on the racism in dating apps
	- I wonder if this is also the case in practice or only if the user is offered the option like on OKC.
	- The golden standard of beauty derives fron American standards of good looks and then paraded around us on billboards media, etc. So when compared to other ethnicities people often fall short. Small narrow upturned nose, fair skin, height, blonde straight hair, round eyelids. Just take a look at the types of cosmetic surgeries offered in Asian countries surgeries like Japan where they've demonstrated a mild American obsession. In contrast, black features are the opposite, wide nose, dark skin, bushy hair. 
	- much of this stuff is kinda make believe for example Hugh hefner popularized because of his own personal preference and today blondes are the standard of all American beauty just a look at the number of women who dye thier hair to look blonde
	- also it's region specific, don draper vs some beachy star, would have better odds. Things aren't static. Experiment around to see what region is better for you, bring up Sa and na racism. 

Dating advice Reddit. Can I get a breakout of ethnicities?

If the odds aren't in my favor is all lost?
	- grit quote
	- suboptimality not an impediment
	- women said to be more psychologocal driven


Advice
-----
Don't rush: to be original you don't have to be first, you just have to be different and better. more time to expand creative process thought
	don't ever self-doubt, it's the antithesis to self-confidence. 
		always isolate to the specific event
	first movers often fail the most: napster, myspace, altavista

How the encoding works for Facial Recognition vs FaceNet (cutting edge)?
	- Facial recognition quick overview 
	ResNet-34 
	the network has already been trained to create 128-d embeddings on a dataset of ~3 million images.
	- Facenet's supposed to be the best out there and probably should be used in the final version of this. But it's for a later iteration.

What are the best Tinder hacks?
https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Tinder-hacks
The girls who were writing boasted highest views, naturally women are the most concerned with relationships.

I should offer suggestions, because what the popular views of quoro show people want to learn: experiment around most importnatly - this is like an arms race and behooves you to stay uptodate, see what other guys are doing after you create a new profile of the opposite sex and do something better than them. e.g. create interesting photoshopped images. Answers and hacks are constantly bubbling up and people are constantly adapting to them as such, good ol fashioned trial and error is the only way to continually stay ahead of the pack.

How often do you find yourself focusing on what you lack when it comes to your dating success( or there lack of)?
- Like only if I was taller, then I'd get more matches, only if I was x,y,z then these are some interesting opportunities to experiment with and remember when you're a new person, you're profile will automatically get shown more.

Know your customer, girls.
Look at their bios and read about what they want in a man and see if you can cater to it. ( this tough this assumes they're aware of what they want, girls are always saying shit like they want a nice and end-up with the badboy), but it's worth a shot.

More matches isn't necessarily a good thing, polarization

* I should do a clustering exercise on bios

what was the success rate of me matching with any of these people?
Not sure, that wasnt a part of the exercise but very low and I was only interested in finding my taste for this very reason. (https://www.quora.com/Am-I-ugly-if-I-can-t-get-matches-on-Tinder-Because-I-have-been-told-my-pictures-are-nice-but-I-have-been-on-Tinder-for-3-weeks-and-only-have-1-match). I know it's driven by the elo-score or whatever but in either case, it's too damn time consuming and my odds IRL are much better.

What are the universal laws of attraction?
Men one's that are more concerned with looks, as such the article will probably cater to men however there's a sense of individual expression through photos, afterall they're worth a 1000 words. 

Suggestions on where to go based on your use case? to flat out say Tinder < Bumble << OKC is kind of short-sighted to their individual use-case.

	- Are you aware of them and why?
	- You have some sort of nonsense about women in your bio. This includes: demanding to pay for the first date, talking about how women who sleep with you are easy, “not looking for sluts”, calling girls “bitches”, and so on. Ew.

	Why should a guy bother with Tinder if he does not have a six pack and grade A looks?
